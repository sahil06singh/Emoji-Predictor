# Emoji-Prediction


**Emojis** are the incredible way of expressing yourself.Therefore, our machines should also be aware of the appropriate emoji to be used at the right time. Thus, this project does the same.  
In this project, the model is predicting emoji's according to a given sentence using Deep Learning Models.

# Algorithm's Used
-LSTM
-RNN

**Emoji Prediction.ipynb**   
This python script contains the code for both the models and their predictions.


# Additional Files
In this project, I have used the 6B 50D glove vector to build embedding matrix of words available in the glove vector.<br>
Download the 6B.50.50d.txt file and extract the file in the same directory as that of the code.<br>
